## Description 

This project is a custom-built macropad featuring two rotary encoders and six buttons, designed for managing volume, scrolling pages, and other productivity tasks. It was created for fun and as a way to explore 3D modeling and electronics. The case was 3D printed, combining functionality and a personal touch.

This macropad is a simple and practical device built for everyday use and learning along the way.

## What do you need?

- Arduino Micro (Don't use the Nano version, as it doesn't have the HID)
- A few wires
- Keyboard switches
- Encoders HW-040
- 2 neodymium magnets 6x3 mm
- Some soldering skills
- 3D printer (or a service for 3D printing)

## Software part

- [Install](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/getting-started-arduino/) Arduino IDE and drivers 
- Clone and open lighthouse.ino
- Open "Library manager" tab
- Search and download "HID-Project" library
- In the upper-left corner select the model of your board
- Connect Arduino
- Press Upload

## Hardware part

- Download stl files from 3D Models folder
- Print it out!
- Paint the case however you like to make it uniquely yours
- Solder the wires
- Assemble everything (Use hot glue to securely attach the Arduino)

## Special Thanks  

- To my wonderful [Love](https://github.com/alivepotatoes) for helping me paint the case and making it look amazingâ€”thank you for your support and creativity!  
- A huge thanks to [Joe Scotto](https://youtu.be/hjml-K-pV4E?si=GUIzaKLLXJUT6-r2) for his excellent tutorial on how matrix connections work. Your video was incredibly helpful in understanding the wiring!

1. **Painting the Case**  
   This was our first time painting a 3D-printed case. We started by priming the surface and then painted it with acrylics, adding a hand-drawn lighthouse for a unique touch!

2. **Soldering the Wires**  
   A look inside the device, showing how everything is soldered and connected. The HW-040 encoders require 5V to operate properly, but I powered them from the 3.3V pin on the Arduino, which is not the best solution. It works, but keep this in mind if you're planning to replicate the project.

3. **Finished Device**  
   The final result: a fully functional macropad, ready to use!
